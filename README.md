Project Intern Training Repository
MulticoreWare – Framework & Cloud / Systems Track
📌 Overview

This repository contains my structured learning, experiments, and implementation work as part of the Project Intern Training Program at MulticoreWare.

The training focuses on building deep expertise in:

Modern C++

Computer Architecture

Operating Systems

Memory Management

Performance Optimization

Git & Engineering Workflows

Machine Learning (System-Level Understanding)

High-Performance and Scalable Systems

This repository acts as:

📚 A structured knowledge base

💻 A code implementation space

🧠 A system-level learning journal

⚙️ A performance experimentation lab

🎯 Training Objectives

The primary goal of this training is to build strong foundations in system-level thinking and performance engineering, including:
